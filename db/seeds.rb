Then, I read more on the Internet and talked to my vet. I think the BARF (Bones And Raw Food) diet is probably best, but I dont have the resources to do it at this time. Homemade seems to be the next best thing. I definitely feel better about feeding this than did about feeding commercial chow. Its important to vary your dogs diet somewhat, to make sure theyre getting everything that they need. Mine also get a daily multivitamin, plain yogurt, and the occasional whole egg. This diet may not be appropriate for all breeds, so you should check it out with your vet.
    There have been numerous benefits to feeding my little pack this way. They are shinier, have less doggy smell, better breath, smaller stools (because therere more absorbable nutrients and less food filler). They even seem to be a bit more mellow and relaxed.
    Making your own dog food is very easy, and its also pretty cost-effective.",

I also wanted to do this because I have read on many occasions all you need to make a knife are some files and a drill or something to that effect. I was curious as to how long it would take me to make a knife by hand and to see if I could do it without cheating and using my power tools.
